# Task 4 – Method Design & Modular Calculator

## 📌 Description
This project is a modular calculator built using Java.
Each arithmetic operation is implemented using separate methods.

## 🛠 Concepts Used
- Method Design
- Method Overloading
- Return values
- Pass-by-value
- Exception Handling
- Modular Programming

## 📂 Project Structure
- ModularCalculator.java → Main calculator program
- Interview_Questions.txt → Related interview questions
- README.md → Project documentation

## ▶ How to Run
1. Open project in IntelliJ / Eclipse
2. Run `ModularCalculator.java`
3. View output in console

## ✅ Outcome
This task helped me understand clean code structure
and real-world usage of methods in Java.

📄 Interview_Questions.txt

1) What is method overloading?
   Method overloading means having multiple methods with the same name
   but different parameters (type or count) in the same class.

2) How does Java pass parameters?
   Java always uses pass-by-value. Copies of variables are passed to methods.

3) Difference between return and void?
   return sends a value back to the caller.
   void does not return any value.

4) What is stack memory?
   Stack memory stores method calls, local variables, and references.
   It follows LIFO (Last In First Out).

5) Why is modular code important?
   It improves readability, reusability, debugging, and maintenance.
